# 3D Data Hack Docklands Model Starter Guides

This repository contains starter guides for using the Unity and Unreal Engine to visualise large scale 3D architectural models. They were prepared on behalf of the Building City Dashboards project to assist participants in the 3D Data Hack Dublin 2019.

## 3D Data Hack Dublin

The [3D Data Hack Dublin](https://3ddatahack.ie/) took place on 10 - 12 May 2019 at Autodesk's European headquarters in Dublin's Docklands. The core data set was a specially commissioned 3D model of Dublin's Docklands Strategic Development Zone. The event was organised by Dublin City Council (via the Smart Docklands Programme) and the Grangegorman Development Agency. Other partners included the Public BIM and the Open Data Unit (DPER), The Department of Community and Rural Development, D3D, and the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) funded Building City Dashboards Team at the University of Maynooth.

The model was subsequently released to the public as free open data using a Creative Commons licence (CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0). The data is now available via Dublin's open data portal Dublinked: [3D Data Hack Dublin Resources](https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/3d-data-hack-dublin-resources)
