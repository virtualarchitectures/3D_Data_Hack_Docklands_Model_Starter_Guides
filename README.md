# 3D Data Hack Docklands Model Starter Guides

This repository contains starter guides which were prepared for participants in the 3D Data Hack Dublin to help them visualise the newly commissioned open 3D model of Dublin's Docklands. More generally the guides demonstrate the use of real-time interactive gaming technology, Unity and the Unreal Engine, for the visualisation of large scale 3D architectural models.

## 3D Data Hack Dublin

The [3D Data Hack Dublin](https://3ddatahack.ie/) took place on 10 - 12 May 2019 at Autodesk's European headquarters in Dublin's Docklands. The core data set was a specially commissioned 3D model of Dublin's Docklands Strategic Development Zone. The model was produced by [D3D (DigiTech 3D)](http://www.d3d.ie/) and was subsequently released to the public as a free open data set via Dublin's open data portal Dublinked: [3D Data Hack Dublin Resources](https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/3d-data-hack-dublin-resources)
